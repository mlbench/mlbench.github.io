## Benchmark Task
Distributed SGD for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### ML model

|key | value |
|:----:|:----:|
|model | ResNet 20 with Pre-Activation <a href="#kaiming16identity">[2]</a>|
|dataset | CIFAR-10|
|dataset preprocessing| described in <a href="#kaiming15deep">[1]</a>|
|weight decay| 0.0001|
|#parallel workers (data loading)| 0 |

## Training Algorithm
Standard mini-batch distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

- TODO: describe basic algo first, details later

### Learning rate
There are 3 aspects to consider: `scaling`, `warmup`, `scheduling`

#### Scaling learning rates by number of machines
We use `k` for the number of machines and `b` for minibatch size per worker. 

The `Linear Scaling Rule` in <a href="#goyal2017accurate">[3]</a> states:
>Linear Scaling Rule: When the minibatch size is multiplied by `k`, multiply the learning rate by `k`.

In each iteration, `k*b` samples are trained. If no scaling is used, then 
```python
lr = eta * b
```
where `eta` is learning rate per sample. If we use `Linear Scaling Rule`, then
```python
lr = eta * b * k
```

In <a href="#kaiming15deep">[1]</a> they use learning rate `0.1=k*b*eta=2*128*eta=256*eta` for 2 workers with batch size of 128. So here we choose `eta=0.1/256` 

#### Warmup to scaled learning rates

In <a href="#goyal2017accurate">[3]<a> they use a `warmup` strategy which
>using lower learning rates at the start of training to overcome early optimization difficulties.

In this experiment we start from a learning rate of `eta * b` and linearly increase it to `eta * b * k` with in `5` epochs.

#### Scheduling
We reduce the learning rate by `0.1` at 82-th, 109-th epoch for all workers.
This is similar to <a href="#kaiming15deep">[1]</a> which reduces at 32k-th, 48k-th iterations.

### Dataset

The datasets are partitioned by nodes. Each worker only has access to part of the data.

## Hardware / System

_Note: This preliminary results uses Google cloud kubernetes instances. We will work to obtain results for other clouds and instances soon. Since we do not have enough quotas for 64 GPUs, only CPUs are used._
