  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine
translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural
machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be
jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed
recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of
encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into
a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this
paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in
improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and
propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for
parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,
without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new
approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing
state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French
translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the
(soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},
